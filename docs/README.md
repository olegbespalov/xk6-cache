# xk6-cache

xk6-cache enables vendoring [Remote HTTP(s) modules](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/modules#remote-http-s-modules) to single source control friendly file.

k6 supports importing [Remote HTTP(s) modules](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/modules#remote-http-s-modules). The imported modules will be downloaded and executed at runtime. Relying on external servers is convenient for development but brittle in production.
Production software should always vendor its dependencies.

Using xk6-cache this is done by pointing `$XK6_CACHE` to some project-local file at runtime, and similarly checking that into source control:

```bash
# Download the dependencies.
XK6_CACHE=vendor.k6c k6 run --out cache script.js

# Make sure the variable is set for any command which invokes the cache.
XK6_CACHE=vendor.k6c k6 run script.js

# Check the cache file into source control.
git add -u vendor.k6c
git commit
```

Usage of xk6-cache extension is transparent for k6 scripts. However sometimes good to see some metrics about cache usage (number of entries, cache hit count, cache miss count).

You may call measure() function to enable cache metrics.

```JavaScript
import cache from "k6/x/cache";

export function setup() {
cache.measure()
}
```

After cache metrics is enabled, the normal k6 metrics output will include the following three metrics:

```
    xk6_cache_entry_count...: 5
    xk6_cache_hit_count.....: 3
    xk6_cache_miss_count....: 0
```
